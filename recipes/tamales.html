<h5>Leftover Turkey Tamales</h5>
<p>These tamales take some time, but are well worth the effort. They are a great way to use up leftover holiday turkey. These are also healthier than many traditional tamale recipes which are made with lard. These freeze well and can later be either microwaved or re-steamed. Serve with lime wedges as garnish.
    Ingredients Include: 
    1 5-ounce package cornhusks;
    Tamale Dough:
    3 cups masa harina;
    1 tablespoon paprika;
    1 tablespoon chili powder;
    1 tablespoon garlic powder;
    1 teaspoon ground cumin;
    1 teaspoon salt;
    1 cup corn oil;
    1 quart turkey broth, divided;
    Turkey Filling:
    1 tablespoon olive oil;
    1 onion, finely chopped;
    2 cloves garlic, minced;
    3 ½ cups finely chopped cooked turkey;
    1 teaspoon paprika;
    1 teaspoon dried oregano;
    1 teaspoon ground cumin;
    1 teaspoon chili powder;
    1 teaspoon salt;
    ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper;
    ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste.

    <li>Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water until softened, about 1 hour; drain.</li>
    <li>Mix masa, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon chili powder, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Stir corn oil into masa mixture. Measure 1/2 cup turkey broth and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; saute onion and garlic until softened and translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.

Stir reserved 1/2 cup turkey broth into filling until moistened.</li>
    <li>Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon dough in the center of each corn husk. Top filling with 1 heaping tablespoon filling. Roll husk around dough and filling, tucking bottom of husk into tamale. Tie a corn husk strip or string around each tamale to secure.    </li>
